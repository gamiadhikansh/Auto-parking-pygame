This project focuses on simulating an autonomous parking system using Pygame, a versatile Python library that facilitates the creation of interactive applications and games. Pygame provides a user-friendly environment for visualizing the parking process, allowing users to interact with the simulation and observe the vehicle's navigation in real-time. The graphical capabilities of Pygame enable the representation of the parking lot, vehicles, and obstacles, making it an ideal tool for developing and testing autonomous parking algorithms.
To enhance the vehicle's navigation capabilities, the project employs the A* algorithm, a well-known pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. The A* algorithm is particularly effective for finding the shortest path from a starting point to a destination while considering various obstacles in the environment. By integrating the A* algorithm into the simulation, the autonomous vehicle can efficiently plan its route to the designated parking spot, optimizing its movements and minimizing the risk of collisions. 
Through this project, we aim to provide insights into the development of autonomous systems and their applications in real-world scenarios, ultimately contributing to the advancement of intelligent vehicle technology.
